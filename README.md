Required modules: os, pywinauto, pyautogui, time, datetime, random\
Python version: Python3

The code creates 2 folders and a file with a unique content and name.
It opens the folders and then drags them to the opposite parts of the screen so that the windows do not overlap.
Then it relocates a file from one folder to another using the keyboard copying, dragging, and right-click copying
Finally, it deletes the files from both folders and closes them.

Currently it works for the following path: (C:\\Users\User\Desktop\<folder_to_be_created_name>)
