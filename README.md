# users_actions_automation
Automation of different user's actions with python


Required modules: os, pywinauto, pyautogui, time, datetime, random
Python version: Python3

The code creates 2 folders for testing, and a file with a unique content and name. 
It opens the folders and then drags them to the opposite parts of the screen so that the windows not overlap.
Then it copies a file from one folder and pastes it to another folder using the keyboard. 
Finally, it deletes the files from both folders and closes them.

Currently it works for the default path (C:\\Users\User\Desktop\<folder_to_be_created_name>)
